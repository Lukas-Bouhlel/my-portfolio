                    Beyond my professional activities, I thrive in various hobbies that reflect my curiosity and love for knowledge. Reading holds a special place in my life, nourishing my mind with diverse knowledge. My interest in botany connects me with nature and allows me to appreciate the complexity of the plant world. However, my true playground is computer science. I find unparalleled satisfaction in creating innovative and aesthetic solutions through my expertise in various technologies. My preferences include React, Symfony, HTML, CSS, JS, PHP, Shopify, Vue.js, Node.js, and SQL. These tools enable me to bring my ideas to life and build unique digital experiences. Whether it's in lines of code or within the pages of a book, I am constantly seeking new opportunities to grow, learn, and make my mark in the ever-evolving digital world.
